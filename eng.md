About a year ago, I was on a conference call. The customer was a Fortune 500
company with a correspondingly enormous web presence, and they wanted some help 
validating that their new[SASS][1] architecture would result in CSS that would
perform well across devices.<aside class="content-minutiae"></aside>

One of their developers was giving an informal presentation about their
progress. He said something to me that I can paraphrase as: “SASS’s new 
placeholder syntax is pretty great, isn’t it?
”

There was a stutter and a pause, that sound of windy emptiness on the call,
while I gathered my wits.

“Actually, I’m not familiar with it,” I said.

## Owning up to posturing

Not long before, I had started noticing a habit I had, a tendency to nod or
make vague assentive noises when people around me talked about things I’d never 
heard of.

When I did this, my motivation wasn’t to claim knowledge I didn’t have as
much as to deflect a need for outright admission of ignorance. I’d let the 
moment glide past and later scamper off to furtively study up.

I recognized this in myself, this fear of looking like I didn’t know what the
hell I was doing, and I didn’t love it. At the same time, there was so much to 
keep on top of—JavaScript frameworks, browser bugs, devices, hacks, techniques, 
workarounds, etc.—that to be entirely informed about all of these things wasn’t 
feasible either, no matter the level of effort.

I decided that I wanted to come to terms with not knowing everything, to be
able to say*never heard of it* and not feel panicky.

## Finding confidence in a hazy profession

This was easier resolved than done.

I go through periods of self-doubt about my qualifications as a web developer.
I have a sense I’m not alone in this. Our field is by nature a generalists’ 
field, where expertise involves synthesis of concepts and technologies, not 
complete mastery of a single, static topic. It’s hard to know how to tell if you
’re good at your job.

On closer self-reflection, I realized my fear wasn’t that I’d *look* like I
didn’t know what I was doing, but that maybe I actually*didn’t know what I
was doing*.

There’s no defined lesson plan or standardized test for the many branches of
real-world applied web development, and the whole profession is a moving target.
So if we can’t possibly know everything, all the time, what things do we need to
know?

## Can you Google it?

As I surveyed the patterns in my daily information bombardment, one dichotomy
appeared rather quickly. Boiling it down to a quick litmus test: some things can
be easily Googled for when needed, and some things cannot.

This is a useful barometer, a differentiator between things to *reference*
versus concepts to*know*. Of course, I’d still have to have the guts to admit
when I didn’t have these minutiae at my mental fingertips, but I felt more 
confident once I recognized them for the details that they were.

## All in good time

On good mornings, I have time to read my RSS feeds. Most mornings, however, are
not good. Last week was a multi-day pitched battle waged between an outdated 
version of[PhoneGap][2] and native status bars in iOS7. There were no ceasefire
agreements to allow for checking the latest updates on Feedly.

This daily task of separating the noisy chaff from the meaningful wheat is
another piece of our knowledge burden, a vague necessity akin to being*well-
read* or *informed*. Except that while I feel like I have a lifetime to read
the major Athenian dramatists, I suffer from a nagging, constant twitch to check
the latest tech headlines.

But wherefore the urgency? Yep, it is a worthwhile thing to keep current, to
have general awareness of the newest Nexus phone or that a slew of unpleasant 
WebKit bugs are coming your way, but it’s the knowledge and skills one can’t 
glean from a news feed or a speedy Googling that make or break us.

That is, higher-level concepts: software architecture, the successful union of
Responsive Web Design techniques, working on distributed teams, the application 
of design patterns, usability concerns—these are what web mastery are built from,
and so these should be the linchpins of my own personal, continuing curriculum.

## Re-calibrating the knowledge burden

With the web, as with soccer in my childhood, I play the midfield. Rooted
neither in the front end nor the backend, I have to run around a lot. During 
fierce matches, frenetic and muddy, I have no time to assess strategy except in 
a lower-brain, reactive fashion.

And so part of upping my game was to remove myself selectively from active play
, to assert calculated time-outs and extended practice sessions, allowing me to 
survey the current lay of the technical field and to master certain complex 
maneuvers without the crowd watching, all the while boosting my confidence in my
own competence.

And thus my strategy: dimming down the details a bit; employing just-in-time
Googling; pruning my news sources and allotting time for longer-term study of 
deeper topics that matter. Choosing my battles and pursuing those doggedly while
ignoring distracting skirmishes; acknowledging that there will be some border 
incursions I will fail to foresee. Being able to hold my chin up when faced with
the latter—that’s the rub, and it comes with confidence in one’s own game plan 
and growth.

We are not going to know all of the things, nor are we going to know them
immediately. No, in fact, I*haven’t* tried out that JavaScript framework yet (
stop looking incredulous). I*didn’t* see that one guy’s tweet about that
memory leak thing. But I*do* know quite a bit about SASS placeholders now. Isn
’t it fun to learn?

Maybe what I should have said on that conference call was, “I’m not
familiar with it
…*yet*.”
